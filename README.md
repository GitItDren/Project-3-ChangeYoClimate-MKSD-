# Climate Impact Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort by Dren LaPhayne, Kandace Johnson, Marvina Larry, and Skye Johnson. The aim of this project is to create a visualization that captures the impact of climate change on natural resources. To achieve this goal, we have utilized various technologies and tools including Java, Flask, Pandas, Python, MongoDB, and HTML.

### Technologies Used
- Java: Java programming language has been used for backend development, ensuring robust and efficient server-side processing.

- Flask: Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, has been employed to handle HTTP requests and serve the web application.

- Pandas: Pandas, a powerful data analysis library for Python, has been used to manipulate and analyze data effectively.

- Python: Python programming language has been used for various tasks including data analysis, scripting, and backend logic.

- MongoDB: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, has been utilized for storing and managing data related to natural resources and climate change impacts.

- HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

### Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive visualization that effectively communicates how natural resources are being affected by climate change. By leveraging the power of data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to raise awareness about the urgent need for environmental conservation and sustainable practices.
